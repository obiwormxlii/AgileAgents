# AI Agile Team Replacement System - Vision Document

## 1. Project Overview

The project aims to create an AI Agent system to replace an agile team for personal software development projects, specifically for designing apps and web apps.

## 2. Core Objectives

*   Generate requirement specifications (high-level user stories and smaller sub-stories).
*   Generate design documents.
*   Generate API documentation.
*   Decompose complex problems into actionable chunks.
*   Integrate seamlessly with Python and SvelteKit.

## 3. Success Criteria

*   The AI Agent system can generate comprehensive requirement specifications, design documents, and API documentation.
*   The system effectively decomposes complex software development problems into manageable tasks.
*   The system integrates smoothly with Python and SvelteKit development environments.
*   The user can efficiently use the system to accelerate their personal software development projects.

## 4. Stakeholder Considerations

*   **User (Developer):** The primary stakeholder is the individual developer who will use the AI Agent system to streamline their personal projects. Their needs and preferences should be prioritized during development.

## 5. Constraints and Assumptions

*   **Familiar Technologies:** The developer is familiar with Python and SvelteKit, influencing technology choices.
*   **Scope Limitation:** The system focuses on documentation generation and problem decomposition, not full agile team replacement (e.g., testing, deployment).

## 6. Strategic Alignment

*   This project aligns with the developer's goal to enhance personal productivity by automating key tasks in the software development lifecycle, allowing them to focus on core coding and innovation.
