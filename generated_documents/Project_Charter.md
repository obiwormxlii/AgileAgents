# Project Charter: AI Agile Team Replacement

## 1. Project Overview

*   **Project Title:** AI Agile Team Replacement
*   **Project Goal:** Develop an AI Agent system to replace an agile team for personal projects, focusing on documentation generation and problem decomposition.
*   **Objectives:**
    *   Generate high-level user stories and break them down into smaller stories.
    *   Generate requirement specifications, design documents, and API documentation.
    *   Integrate with Python and SvelteKit projects.
*   **Project Manager:** AI Assistant

## 2. Scope

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Development of AI agent modules for user story generation, documentation generation, and problem decomposition.
    *   Integration with Python and SvelteKit.
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Full replacement of all agile team roles (e.g., testing, deployment).
    *   Support for other programming languages or frameworks beyond Python and SvelteKit.

## 3. Deliverables

*   Module for generating high-level user stories.
*   Algorithm for breaking down user stories.
*   Module for generating requirement specifications.
*   Module for generating design documents.
*   Module for generating API documentation.
*   Plugins/extensions for Python and SvelteKit.
*   Example projects demonstrating integration.

## 4. Timeline

*   **Phase 1:** User Story Generation and Decomposition (4 weeks)
*   **Phase 2:** Documentation Generation (6 weeks)
*   **Phase 3:** Python/SvelteKit Integration (4 weeks)
*   **Total Estimated Time:** 14 weeks

## 5. Resources

*   AI Engineer
*   Software Engineer
*   Technical Writer

## 6. Risks and Mitigation

*   **Risk:** Difficulty in accurately interpreting project descriptions.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement a feedback loop for refining the AI model.
*   **Risk:** Suboptimal decomposition of user stories.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use established story decomposition techniques.
*   **Risk:** Inconsistent documentation style.
    *   **Mitigation:** Establish documentation guidelines.
*   **Risk:** Difficulty in extracting relevant information from code.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use code analysis tools to extract information.
*   **Risk:** Compatibility issues with different versions of Python and SvelteKit.
    *   **Mitigation:** Thorough testing with different versions.
*   **Risk:** Performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Mitigation:** Optimize code for performance.
