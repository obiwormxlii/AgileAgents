# Sprint 1 Backlog

**Goal:** Develop the core AI agent capability to generate and decompose user stories, including setting up the API Gateway.

## User Stories:

1.  As a developer, I want the AI Agent to generate high-level user stories from a project description, so that I can quickly define the scope of my project. (High Priority)
    *   Tasks:
        *   Implement the User Story Generator Service.
        *   Integrate the service with the API Gateway.
        *   Write unit tests for the service.
        *   Deploy the service to a staging environment.
2.  As a developer, I want the AI Agent to break down high-level user stories into smaller, actionable user stories, so that I can easily manage the development tasks. (High Priority)
    *   Tasks:
        *   Implement the User Story Decomposition Service.
        *   Integrate the service with the API Gateway.
        *   Write unit tests for the service.
        *   Deploy the service to a staging environment.
3.  As a system, I need an API Gateway that can route requests to User Story Generator and Decomposition Services to ensure scalability. (Medium Priority)
    *   Tasks:
        *   Research and select an API Gateway technology.
        *   Design the API Gateway routing rules.
        *   Implement the API Gateway configuration.
        *   Test the API Gateway routing.
        *   Monitor the API Gateway performance.

## Sprint Goals:

*   Successfully generate high-level user stories from a project description.
*   Successfully break down high-level user stories into smaller, actionable user stories.
*   Set up the API Gateway to route requests to the User Story Generator and Decomposition Services.
