**Phase 1: User Story Generation and Decomposition**

1. As a developer, I want the AI Agent to generate high-level user stories from a project description, so that I can quickly define the scope of my project. (High Priority)
   * Acceptance Criteria: The AI agent generates at least 3 relevant user stories with clear, concise language.
2. As a developer, I want the AI Agent to break down high-level user stories into smaller, actionable user stories, so that I can easily manage the development tasks. (High Priority)
   * Acceptance Criteria: The AI Agent decomposes each high-level story into at least 3 smaller stories, each with a clear acceptance criterion.
3. As a system, I need an API Gateway that can route requests to User Story Generator and Decomposition Services to ensure scalability. (Medium Priority)
   * Acceptance Criteria:
     * Researched and selected API Gateway technology based on performance, scalability, and ease of integration with the microservices architecture.
     * API Gateway routing rules designed and documented.
     * API Gateway configuration implemented with routing rules and necessary security measures.
     * API Gateway routing tested and verified.
     * API Gateway performance monitored and tracked.
