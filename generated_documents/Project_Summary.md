# AI Agile Team Replacement System - Project Summary

## 1. Project Overview

The project aims to create an AI Agent system to replace an agile team for personal software development projects, specifically for designing apps and web apps.

## 2. Core Objectives

*   Generate requirement specifications (high-level user stories and smaller sub-stories).
*   Generate design documents.
*   Generate API documentation.
*   Decompose complex problems into actionable chunks.
*   Integrate seamlessly with Python and SvelteKit.

## 3. Key Components

*   User Interface (UI): A SvelteKit-based web application for user interaction.
*   API Gateway: An Nginx or Traefik reverse proxy that routes requests to the appropriate microservice.
*   Microservices:
    *   User Story Generator Service: Uses Transformers to generate high-level user stories from project descriptions.
    *   User Story Decomposition Service: Uses Transformers to break down high-level user stories into smaller, actionable stories.
    *   Requirements Specification Service: Generates detailed requirement specifications from user stories, leveraging templates and NLP techniques.
    *   Design Document Service: Creates design documents based on requirements and architectural decisions, using templates and diagrams as code.
    *   API Documentation Service: Extracts API documentation from code and generates OpenAPI/Swagger specifications.
    *   Problem Decomposition Service: Breaks down complex software design problems into smaller, manageable tasks.
*   Message Queue (RabbitMQ): Facilitates asynchronous communication between services.
*   Metadata Store (Neo4j): Stores metadata about the project, requirements, designs, code, and tasks to maintain traceability.
*   Data Storage (PostgreSQL): Stores structured data related to projects, user stories, and requirements.

## 4. Technology Stack

*   Programming Language: Python
*   Frameworks:
    *   FastAPI
    *   Celery
*   Message Queue: RabbitMQ
*   Databases:
    *   PostgreSQL
    *   Neo4j
*   AI/ML Libraries:
    *   Transformers (Hugging Face)
    *   Langchain
*   Deployment: Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes.

## 5. Sprint 1 Backlog

Goal: Develop the core AI agent capability to generate and decompose user stories, including setting up the API Gateway.

### User Stories:

1.  As a developer, I want the AI Agent to generate high-level user stories from a project description, so that I can quickly define the scope of my project. (High Priority)
    *   Tasks:
        *   Implement the User Story Generator Service.
        *   Integrate the service with the API Gateway.
        *   Write unit tests for the service.
        *   Deploy the service to a staging environment.
2.  As a developer, I want the AI Agent to break down high-level user stories into smaller, actionable user stories, so that I can easily manage the development tasks. (High Priority)
    *   Tasks:
        *   Implement the User Story Decomposition Service.
        *   Integrate the service with the API Gateway.
        *   Write unit tests for the service.
        *   Deploy the service to a staging environment.
3.  As a system, I need an API Gateway that can route requests to User Story Generator and Decomposition Services to ensure scalability. (Medium Priority)
    *   Tasks:
        *   Research and select an API Gateway technology.
        *   Design the API Gateway routing rules.
        *   Implement the API Gateway configuration.
        *   Test the API Gateway routing.
        *   Monitor the API Gateway performance.

### Sprint Goals:

*   Successfully generate high-level user stories from a project description.
*   Successfully break down high-level user stories into smaller, actionable user stories.
*   Set up the API Gateway to route requests to the User Story Generator and Decomposition Services.

## 6. Updated Definition of Ready (DoR)

*   User story is clearly defined and understandable.
*   Acceptance criteria are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
*   Dependencies are identified and addressed.
*   Design specifications are available (if applicable).
*   Effort estimates are provided by the development team.
*   All necessary resources are available.
*   Design Considerations for User Story Generator and Decomposition Services are addressed, including:
    *   Model Selection:  Justification for the selected pre-trained language model is documented (e.g., DistilBERT, BERT-base).
    *   Fine-tuning: Plans for fine-tuning the model on a relevant dataset are outlined.
    *   Inference Optimization:  Strategies for optimizing the inference pipeline are identified (e.g., model quantization, caching, batch processing).
    *   Error Handling:  Error handling mechanisms are defined for dealing with unexpected inputs or model outputs.
    *   Scalability:  The service's design considers horizontal scalability and deployment behind a load balancer.

## 7. Risks and Mitigation

*   Risk: Difficulty in accurately interpreting project descriptions.
    *   Mitigation: Implement a feedback loop for refining the AI model.
*   Risk: Suboptimal decomposition of user stories.
    *   Mitigation: Use established story decomposition techniques.
*   Risk: Inconsistent documentation style.
    *   Mitigation: Establish documentation guidelines.
*   Risk: Difficulty in extracting relevant information from code.
    *   Mitigation: Use code analysis tools to extract information.
*   Risk: Compatibility issues with different versions of Python and SvelteKit.
    *   Mitigation: Thorough testing with different versions.
*   Risk: Performance bottlenecks.
    *   Mitigation: Optimize code for performance.
