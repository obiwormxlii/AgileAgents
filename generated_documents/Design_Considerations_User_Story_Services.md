# Design Considerations: User Story Generator and Decomposition Services

## 1. Model Selection

*   Consider smaller models like DistilBERT or BERT-base for initial development.
*   Evaluate larger models like GPT-2 or GPT-3 if needed.
*   Consider model size, accuracy, and inference speed.

## 2. Fine-tuning

*   Create or curate a dataset of user stories and project descriptions.
*   Fine-tune the selected model on the dataset.

## 3. Inference Optimization

*   Implement model quantization.
*   Implement caching.
*   Implement batch processing.

## 4. Error Handling

*   Implement input validation.
*   Implement error logging.
*   Implement fallback strategies.

## 5. Scalability

*   Design the services to be horizontally scalable.
*   Deploy multiple instances of the services behind a load balancer.
