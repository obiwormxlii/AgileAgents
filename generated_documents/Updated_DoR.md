# Updated Definition of Ready (DoR)

*   User story is clearly defined and understandable.
*   Acceptance criteria are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
*   Dependencies are identified and addressed.
*   Design specifications are available (if applicable).
*   Effort estimates are provided by the development team.
*   All necessary resources are available.
*   **Design Considerations for User Story Generator and Decomposition Services are addressed, including:**
    *   **Model Selection:**  Justification for the selected pre-trained language model is documented (e.g., DistilBERT, BERT-base).
    *   **Fine-tuning:** Plans for fine-tuning the model on a relevant dataset are outlined.
    *   **Inference Optimization:**  Strategies for optimizing the inference pipeline are identified (e.g., model quantization, caching, batch processing).
    *   **Error Handling:**  Error handling mechanisms are defined for dealing with unexpected inputs or model outputs.
    *   **Scalability:**  The service's design considers horizontal scalability and deployment behind a load balancer.
