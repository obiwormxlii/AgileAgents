I would like to make decisions with the help of the AI agent.


## Project Overview
The project aims to develop an AI-powered multi-agent system designed to streamline the agile project planning process for solo full-stack developers and indie hackers. The AI will simulate various agile team roles, such as Business Analyst, Project Manager, Software Architect, Product Owner, and Scrum Master, to guide users in creating comprehensive project plans.

## Core Objectives
1.  **Facilitate Agile Planning:** Provide a structured and guided approach to agile planning, making it accessible to users without extensive agile experience.
2.  **Generate Project Documentation:** Create well-defined project plans, including technical documentation, epics, and user stories.
3.  **Design Database Schemas:** Assist in designing efficient and scalable database schemas tailored to the project's requirements.
4.  **Decompose Complex Problems:** Break down project ideas into smaller, manageable sections for easier implementation.
5.  **Enable Focus on Development:** Allow developers to concentrate on building the application by offloading the planning and documentation tasks to the AI.

## Success Criteria
1.  Users can easily input project ideas and receive structured guidance on planning.
2.  The AI generates comprehensive and well-organized project plans that include epics, user stories, and technical documentation.
3.  The AI provides database schema designs that are efficient and suitable for the project's needs.
4.  Users report a significant reduction in the time and effort required for project planning.
5.  The final applications built using the AI-generated plans are well-structured and meet user requirements.

## Stakeholder Considerations
*   **Solo Full-Stack Developers and Indie Hackers:** The primary target users who need a streamlined planning process.
*   **The User (You):** As the initial driver of this project, your vision and requirements are paramount.

## Constraints and Assumptions
*   **User Interaction:** The AI will guide the user through the planning process, and the user will make the final decisions.
*   **AI Capabilities:** The AI's ability to provide accurate and relevant guidance depends on the quality of the initial project idea and user input.
*   **Agile Principles:** The AI will adhere to core agile principles and methodologies.

## Strategic Alignment
This project aligns with the broader goal of enabling developers to build applications more efficiently. By automating and simplifying the planning process, it reduces barriers to entry and empowers solo developers and indie hackers to bring their ideas to life more quickly.
